Once in a while when I wake up,
I find myself crying.

The dream I must have had,
I can never recall.

But...
The sensation I've lost something, lingers for a long time after I wake up.

Im always searching for something, for someone.
That feeling has possessed me I think from that day.

That day when the stars came falling.

It was almost as if... as if a scene from a dream.

Nothing more, nothing less...

Than a beautiful view.





Your name is...?
